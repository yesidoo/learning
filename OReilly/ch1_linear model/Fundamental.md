# This is my first Markdown file & the first github project
I planed to spend two weeks(2018-1-11 to 2018-1-25) on learning this book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow-Oâ€™Reilly (2017)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)   
I will push my learning project to github respository everyday and write a summarize for every chapter.   

## This is the summarize of the first chapter   :   
* It's a simple mechine learning project ;
* It contains getting data in jupyter notebook
* It contains preparing data for mechine learning
* It also contains selecting and training a simple model
