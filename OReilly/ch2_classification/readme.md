# Classification 
In this chapter, I learned about simple classification as following:

* The MNIST dataset
* Show images in jupyter notebook
* Train a binary classifier (class 5 and class not 5)
* The classifier: SGDClassifier in sklearn.linear_model
* The Cross-Validation to measure accuracy of classifier
* The performance: confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1_score, the ROC curve and AUC score
* Multiclass Classification and Error Analysis
* Multilabel Classification and Multioutput Classification
